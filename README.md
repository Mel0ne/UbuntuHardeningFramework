# A Definitive Automated Hardening Framework for Ubuntu üîê

The following bash framework stands up and installs several bespoke security toolkits, developed to provide seamless automatic security controls for Ubuntu servers.

### Primary Toolkits
- [x] SSH Intrusion Detection (Custom Daemon) /w Email Alerts & Logs
- [x] Auditd (Hardened Configuration) - /w Email Alerts & Logs
- [x] Automated Fail2Ban Deployment (Hardened Restrictive Configuration with incremental bans) - /w Email Alerts, Logs & Whitelisting
- [x] Automated Upgrading Installation (Security & Critical) Deployment - Cron Jobs, Email Alerts & Logs
- [x] Automated RKHunter Deployment - Scans, Email Alerts, and Cron Job (Daily) (Weekly) /w Email Reports & Logs
- [x] Automated Lynis Deployment - Scans, Source Builds, Fingerprinting, Email Alerts, and Cron Job (Daily) (Weekly) /w Email Reports & Logs
- [x] Firewall (UFW) Deployment - Default Deny, pre-deployment testing, and Email Alerts & Logs
- [x] Automated Shared Memory Hardening & Restriction Deployment (/run/shm)
- [x] Automated Network Kernel Hardening Deployment (TCP/IP Stack Hardening) (E.g., DDoS Mitigation, ICMP, SYN Flood, etc.)
- [x] Automated AppArmor Deployment - Customized Enforcing Profiles & Logging
- [x] Automated Password Policy Deployment - Highly Conservative Configuration & Logging (e.g., Password Complexity, Length, etc.)
- [x] Automated SSH Hardening Deployment - Includes MFA, Key-Based Authentication & Hardened Configuration (e.g., AllowUsers, AllowGroups, etc.)

### Extra Toolkits
- [x] SSH Key generation, keyscan and deployment Scripts (optional)
- [x] Administrative user account creation and hardening (optional)
- [x] AWS DKIM & DMARC Configuration Deployment Toolkits (optional)
- [x] Automated Postfix Forwarding Service Deployment (optional)

### Pre-Installation

There are a couple of important steps to the installation process. You'll first need to ensure your system is up to date and has the necessary packages installed. 

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install -y git
```

# Initial Setup

Then, we can clone the repository and navigate to the hardening directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/error-try-again/auto-harden-ubuntu.git
cd auto-harden-ubuntu/
```

If this is a new installation, and you haven't yet created separate user account that will be used to log in to the server now is the time. It will also be used for administrative access.
The following script automates this process. 
```bash
 ./security/create_administrative_user.sh <your_new_user>
```

### SSH Key Preparation

Once this is done, we can go ahead and create a new SSH key for the user account (on your local machine) or use an existing one/multiple.
```bash
0 % ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "void@null"
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/void/.ssh/id_ed25519): /home/void/.ssh/void-ed25519
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/void/.ssh/void-ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/void/.ssh/void-ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:0pOxo... void@null
void@null ~/.ssh
1 % cat void-ed25519.pub # Copy this key
```

### Configuration

Next, it's important to note that the the project can be executed directly via a single script or as a series of individual standalone scripts. 
If you're executing it as a single script, you can modify the `config.sh` file to include your SSH key mappings, allowed SSH users, Fail2Ban white-listed ips, and email alerts.
- SSH key mappings can be configured to automatically allow PKE access to certain user accounts via SSH.
- Access to the server can be restricted to specific users by modifying the `allowed_ssh_users` csv list.
- Whitelisted IPs can be added to the `ip_whitelist` csv list to prevent them from being banned by Fail2Ban.
- Email alerts can be configured by modifying the `sender` and `recipients` variables respectively.

By default, the installer will try to install and configure a mail forwarding service to your mail transfer authority so that the toolkits can send alerts and logs.
To skip this, just ignore the `sender` and `recipients` variables in the `config.sh` file. In this case, mail will be from and to the localhost.

Modify the `config.sh` file so that it looks similar to the following:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Users are separated by a new line and keys are separated by a comma. 
# You can add as many keys or users as you'd like.
allowed_ssh_pk_user_mappings="admin:ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzwnBnmkSBpiBsqQ== void@null
void:ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzwnBnmkSBpiBsqQ== void@null,ssh-ed2551 AAIDk7VFe example.eg@example.com"

# Users are separated by a comma. These are the users that are allowed to SSH into the server.
allowed_ssh_users="your_user,another_user"

# Whitelisted IPs are separated by a comma. These IPs will not be banned by Fail2Ban.
ip_whitelist="your_ip/32"

# Email alerts are sent from the sender to the recipients. If you want to add multiple recipients, separate them by a comma.
sender="void@your-domain.com.au"
recipients="your-main-email@another-domain.com"

export allowed_ssh_pk_user_mappings allowed_ssh_users ip_whitelist sender recipients
```

### Mailing & Alerts

If you already have a mail transfer authority or relay with TLS enabled and would like to - the following script will help you configure a mail forwarding service to your mail transfer authority so that the toolkits can send alerts and logs.
It's set up to install and configure Postfix to forward all mail to your mail transfer authority over SMTP/TLS on port 587. The script will also install the necessary SASL authentication packages and configure the relay with password authentication. Passwords are hashed and stored in `/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`. All configurations are validated, backed up and timestamped.

```bash
./postfix_forwarding_service_installer.sh my.mail@mailer.com mta.smtp.relay.com

# Installation

Directly as a single script
```bash
pwd # /hardening
chmod +x automated_hardening.sh
./automated_hardening.sh
```

Or as a series of individual standalone scripts - note that running this will not configure proper email alerts.  
```bash
cd /hardening/standalones
find . -type f -name '*.sh' -exec sudo bash {} \;
```

To skip the installation of a specific toolkit, you can use the following command: 
```bash
cd /hardening/standalones
find . -type f -name '*.sh' ! -name 'setup_ssh_intrusion_detection.sh' -exec sudo bash {} \; # Skip SSH Intrusion Detection
```**

Or individually - note certain toolkits use commandline arguments to enable email alerts and more specialized use cases.
```bash
cd /hardening/standalones
chmod +x *.sh
./setup_auditd.sh
# etc...
```

# Roadmap
- [ ] Add precise configuration examples & documentation
- [ ] Additional toolkits (e.g., further kernel hardening, automatic audit remediation, etc.)
- [ ] Additional controls for alerts and logs
- [ ] Streamline configuration for easy deployment
- [ ] Email digests for alerts

# Notes
If for some reason you need to reinstall apt installed configuration files to their defaults, e.g. pam.d, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" $(dpkg -S /etc/pam.d/\* | cut -d ':' -f 1)
```
