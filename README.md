### Installation

```bash

cd auto-harden-ubuntu/hardening
```

### Configuration

Modify the default ip (5.5.5.5) in `/hardening/standalones/fail2ban/setup_fail2ban.sh` to ips which you would like to whitelist, replace the default email addresses (example.com) and modify the files in `/hardening/standalone/sshd/allowed_users.txt` & `/hardening/standalone/sshd/allowed_users_keys.txt` to include your own users and public keys of the users you want to allow to connect to the server.

### Execution

Finally, run the script with the following commands to start the hardening process.
```bash
chmod +x automated_hardening.sh
./automated_hardening.sh
```
